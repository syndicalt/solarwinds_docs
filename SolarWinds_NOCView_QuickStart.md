## SolarWinds NOC View Quick Start Guide

### Introduction to NOC Views
A Network Operations Center (NOC) view in SolarWinds provides a simplified display of critical network statistics, ideal for presentation on a TV screen or mobile device. NOC views are designed to be non-interactive, making them perfect for continuous monitoring in a NOC environment.

### Steps to Create a NOC View

1. **Access the SolarWinds Web Console**:
   - Log in to the SolarWinds Platform Web Console with an account that has the Manage Views privilege.

2. **Navigate to Manage Views**:
   - Click **Settings** > **All Settings**.
   - In the **Views** grouping, click **Manage Views**.

3. **Select or Create a View**:
   - Choose an existing view you want to configure as a NOC view, or click **Add New View** to create one.
   - If creating a new view, name it, select the view type, and click **Submit**.

4. **Edit the View**:
   - Select the view you want to edit and click **Edit**.
   - On the **Customize view** page, select **Enable NOC View**.

5. **Configure Subviews Rotation**:
   - If your view has multiple subviews, specify the rotation interval for how often each subview should be displayed.

6. **Finalize and Preview the NOC View**:
   - Click **Done & Go to NOC** to view your NOC view.
   - The view will display in a clean format without headers, footers, or left navigation.

### Managing NOC Views

- **List and Manage NOC Views**:
  - Go to **Settings** > **All Settings**, and in the **Views** grouping, click **Created NOC views**.
  - Here, you can add, edit, or disable NOC views.

- **Customize NOC View Logo**:
  - In a NOC view, click the **NOC Settings** icon and select **Customize NOC View Logo**.
  - You can upload a custom logo (supported formats: .png, .jpg; max resolution: 900x200 px).

### Tips for Effective NOC Views

- **Optimize Resource Placement**: Ensure that all resources fit on the screen without scrolling.
- **Use Rotation Intervals**: Set appropriate rotation intervals for subviews to keep the display dynamic.
- **Minimize Interaction**: NOC views are designed to be non-interactive, so they should be set up to run continuously without user input.
